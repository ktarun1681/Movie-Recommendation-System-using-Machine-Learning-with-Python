It helps the user to show their favorite movies list based on their given movie.


Recommendation systems are becoming increasingly important in todayâ€™s extremely busy world. People are always short on time with the myriad tasks they need to accomplish in the limited 24 hours. Therefore, the recommendation systems are important as they help them make the right choices, without having to expend their cognitive resources.

The purpose of a recommendation system basically is to search for content that would be interesting to an individual. Moreover, it involves a number of factors to create personalised lists of useful and interesting content specific to each user/individual. Recommendation systems are Artificial Intelligence based algorithms that skim through all possible options and create a customized list of items that are interesting and relevant to an individual. These results are based on their profile, search/browsing history, what other people with similar traits/demographics are watching, and how likely are you to watch those movies. This is achieved through predictive modeling and heuristics with the data available.

Use-cases of Recommendation systems
Recommendations are not a new concept. Even when e-commerce was not that prominent, the sales staff in retail stores recommended items to the customers for the purpose of upselling and cross-selling, and ultimately maximise profit. The aim of recommendation systems is just the same. 
Another objective of the recommendation system is to achieve customer loyalty by providing relevant content and maximising the time spent by a user on your website or channel. This also helps in increasing customer engagement. 
On the other hand, ad budgets can be optimized by showcasing products and services only to those who have a propensity to respond to them.
